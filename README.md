> Transform PDF transcripts and conversations into structured teaching materials using AI

AI LectureForge is an advanced AI system that converts PDF transcripts and conversational content into well-structured teaching materials. It seamlessly processes PDF inputs, extracting and analyzing the content to create organized, pedagogically sound lecture materials. Designed for educators, content creators, and anyone looking to transform knowledge sharing.

## ‚ú® Features

- ü§ñ PDF transcript processing and text extraction
- ü§ñ AI-powered content transformation
- üìö Structured teaching material generation
- üîÑ Coherent topic organization
- üîå Support for multiple AI providers (Gemini/OpenAI)
- ‚è±Ô∏è Time-marked sections for lecture pacing

## Output Format

The generated teaching materials follow a structured format:

### Time Markers
- Each section includes time markers (e.g., `[11:45]`) to help instructors pace their lectures
- 30-minute version: Sections are timed appropriately for a condensed lecture
- 60-minute version: Expanded content with more detailed timing

### Structure
- Introduction with learning objectives
- Time-marked content sections
- Examples and practical applications
- Interactive elements (questions, exercises)
- Recap and key takeaways

For example:
```
[00:00] Introduction to Topic
- Learning objectives
- Key concepts overview

[11:45] Main Concept Explanation
- Detailed explanation
- Practical example
- Student interaction point

[23:30] Advanced Applications
...
```

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Virtual environment (recommended)
- Gemini API key (or OpenAI API key)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-lecture-forge.git
cd ai-lecture-forge

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables (choose one API key based on your preference)
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-gemini-api-key'  # Primary option
# OR
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-openai-api-key'  # Alternative option

# On Windows use:
# set GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
# set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key
```

### Usage

```bash
# Run with Python path set
PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:. python src/app.py

# Access the web interface
# Open http://localhost:7860 in your browser
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Approach

### Prompt Engineering Strategy

Our system uses a sophisticated multi-stage prompting approach:

1. **Content Analysis & Chunking**
   - Smart text segmentation for handling large documents (9000+ words)
   - Contextual overlap between chunks to maintain coherence
   - Key topic and concept extraction from each segment

2. **Structure Generation**
   - Time-based sectioning (30/60 minute versions)
   - Educational flow design with clear progression
   - Integration of pedagogical elements (examples, exercises, questions)

3. **Educational Enhancement**
   - Transformation of casual content into formal teaching material
   - Addition of practical examples and case studies
   - Integration of interaction points and reflection questions
   - Time markers for pacing guidance

4. **Coherence Validation**
   - Cross-reference checking between sections
   - Verification of topic flow and progression
   - Consistency check for terminology and concepts
   - Quality assessment of educational elements

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Context Length Management**
   - Challenge: Handling documents beyond model context limits
   - Solution: Implemented sliding window chunking with overlap
   - Result: Successfully processes documents up to 9000+ words with extensibility for more

2. **Educational Structure**
   - Challenge: Converting conversational text to teaching format
   - Solution: 
     - Structured templating system for different time formats (30/60 min)
     - Integration of pedagogical elements (examples, exercises)
     - Time-based sectioning with clear progression
   - Result: Coherent, time-marked teaching materials with interactive elements

3. **Content Coherence**
   - Challenge: Maintaining narrative flow across chunked content
   - Solution: 
     - Contextual overlap between chunks
     - Topic tracking across sections
     - Cross-reference validation system
   - Result: Seamless content flow with consistent terminology

4. **Educational Quality**
   - Challenge: Ensuring high pedagogical value
   - Solution:
     - Integration of learning objectives
     - Strategic placement of examples and exercises
     - Addition of reflection questions
     - Time-appropriate pacing markers
   - Result: Engaging, structured learning materials

### Core Components

1. **PDF Processing**: Extracts and cleans text from PDF transcripts
2. **Content Analysis**: Uses AI to understand and structure the content
3. **Teaching Material Generation**: Transforms content into educational format

### Implementation Details

1. **PDF Handling**
   - Robust PDF text extraction
   - Clean-up of extracted content

2. **AI Processing**
   - Integration with Gemini API (primary)
   - OpenAI API support (alternative)
   - Structured prompt system for consistent output

3. **Output Generation**
   - Organized teaching materials
   - Clear section structure
   - Learning points and key concepts

### Architecture

The system follows a modular design:

- üìÑ PDF processing module
- üîç Text analysis component
- ü§ñ AI integration layer
- üìù Output formatting system
